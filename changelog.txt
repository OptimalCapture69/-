build 1.0.8 :
- Added: system functions for semaphores management (blocking counters);
- Added: ignoring of exceptions thrown by the functions that are executed without waiting;
- Fixed: sometimes resulted in statistics loss when a robot performed a user-defined function;
- Fixed: unblocking of the statistics database by the interpreter at the moment of sending requests to the robot selection modules;
- Fixed: logical (and/or) operations priority;
- Fixed: delayed variable initialization;
- Removed: robot selection by priority if the robot's selection module couldn’t make selection;
- Removed: support of robot selection for robot modules with API versions 000 and 100.

build 1.0.7 :
- The function of recording the robots??™ statistics, and the mechanism of accumulating the experience of using robots have been added;
- A new type of modules has been added - the robots selection modules make it possible to enter one??™s own algorithms of distributing tasks between the robots;
- The mechanism of localizing the system messages has been added. Russian localization has been added;
- New RCML system functions have been added for the interlocking mechanism, which makes it possible to monitor the functions performed by the robots in parallel;
- Multi-line comments have been added;
- Several bugs that had caused memory leaks have been fixed;
- The critical errors in the compiler that caused failure in case of a particular set of instructions have been fixed;
- The critical bug that caused a failure when a robot finished the last instruction in the set has been fixed.

build 1.0.6 :
- Some optimizations for PCode;
- Added the deletion of dead RCML code & non-reached RCML code;
- Fixed syntax bugs with robot's vars: 
    For robot functions: use of robot's vars is prohibited;
    For user functions: use of robot's vars is prohibited in expressions; 
- Fix bug with use the continue operator outside the loop;
- Fix bug with try & catch into loop;
- Rename UID to IID keyword (Interface identifier);
- Added more deep optimizations for PCode (work time of compiler few increased);
- Fix bug for the inadmissible indexes of commands of modules;
- Added feature for throw & catch exception value;
- Added PCode backward compatibility;
- Added feature for the communicate RCML programs with OS through RCML interpreter:
  - Pass the command line params to params into main function;
  - Pass return value of main function to OS as exit code;
  - Pass exception to OS as exit code 1;
- Updated syntax map.

build 1.0.5 :
- Added detailed output of erros;
- Fixed bugs with invalid characters into lexical analysis;
- Fixed bug with pre parser error outputs;
- Fixed bug with old version of bison;

- Fixed bug when module produce error for start program;
- Added suppport for api's versions of modules (multiversions of api);
- Fixed bug for the search lib paths;
- Fixed initiliazed bug with system function - input;
- Added support for RCML-Repository system (only for freeware modules).

build 1.0.4 :
- Packages of commands added;
- Wait flags feature added for user functions;
- Improve synchronizations of robots.

build 1.0.3:
- Integration with repository added;
- Critical bugfixes;
- New api for modules;
- Modules of RCML added to CI system.

build 1.0.2:
